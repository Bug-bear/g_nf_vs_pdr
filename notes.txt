3. IEEE802154E.c

  piggy306b: set the mask to use based on what kind of neighbour we will hear from 
  piggy307a: entering NF slots
  piggy307b: triggered NF NF probe activities
  - piggy308: whether wait for ACK of RPT
  piggy309:  diables retransmission - if no ACK received, just move on to next one
  piggy310: update parent's mask record from a valid ADV from parent 
  - piggy311a: read sender's mask update if this is BLKA pkt
  - piggy311b: read children's mask report from their BLKA pkts
  piggy312a: manipulate received payload if data
  piggy312b: manipulate received payload if data
  piggy313: insert local_mask to ADV

  piggy315: come up with next usable channel
  - piggy316a: apply upstream temp mask
  piggy316b: apply downstream temp mask
  piggy317a: manipulate outgoing payload if from BBK
  piggy317b: manipulate outgoing payload if from BBK
  
  
4. IEEE802154.h
  - piggy401: upstream BL update type
  
5. res.c
  - piggy501: builds upstream BL reports

  piggy701: neighbour's channel mask
  piggy702: get own parent addr
  piggy703: channel mask at the neighbour
  
8. neighbor.c
  The graph relies on DAGroot as only after synchronised with DAGroot can 2nd-level motes start sending ADVs.

  piggy8:   desabling response to Ack requests
  d - piggy9:   insert custom payload
  piggy14:  (in pair) check if need to send ACK
  piggy24:  store the record of children's mask from BLKA pkts
  d - piggy32: check RPT packet first
  d - piggy33b:  only apply temp mask after a RES packet is sent (ADV or whatever in future)
  d - piggy34:  local_t_mask update from noiseprobe module (comment together with sendUp to disable BL)
  piggy38a: insert local_t_mask into outgoing ACK (p-2-m) - (not temp mask in case this ACK is sent before the ADV)
  piggy38b: read parent's mask from ACK
